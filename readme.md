# Introducing Javaughn Pryce
My name is Javaughn Pryce and I love writing code.

I started my programming journey back in 2019 and I fell in love ever since. I am versed in a lot of programming languages but my language of choice is Python and Javascript/Typescript.

I hope to get a better understanding of software and the nitty gritty that goes into making a good one.
